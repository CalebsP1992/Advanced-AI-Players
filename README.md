Download the AI_1.0.2.zip and extract it. Upload the AI folder to your server resources and edit the server.cfg file:

add:
ensure AI

save the cfg file and restart your server. Now anytime a player logs into the server, they'll see golden blips on the map, these are the AI Players.

If a player dies the AI will travel to them in a mesa and revive them and then RTB. Messages updating the player will appear on the right side 
of the screen.

There are plans to improve this script to include real AI and learning. 

If you have any questions, reach out to me on Discord, the server is called SBB City, I'm PlayDough AKA Bjorn Ironside, see ya there.
